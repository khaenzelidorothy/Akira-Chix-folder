  		Comparison operators - used to compare values and always return True or False
  	Operator	 Meaning	       Example		Result
  ==		equal to( if values are equal)	3==3   True(value if a==b)otherwise(False)
  !=		not equal to			       True(value if a!=b)otherwise False
  <		less than			       True(value if a<b)otherwise False
  <=		less than or equals to		       True(value if a<=b)otherwise False
  >		Greater than			       True(value if a>b)otherwise False
  >=		Greater than or equals to	     True(value if a>=b)otherwise False
