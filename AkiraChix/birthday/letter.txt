Dear Brenda,
I hope that you're in good health. I am fit as a fiddle. I have been a little busy in the farm since the rains are almost here with us but I have been keeping well.

A lot of water has gone under the bridge since we last met I am just about to complete my 21st trip about the sun and i would like the pleasure of your company in celebrating my birthday on the 26th of February.

I have set aside three of my fattest hens to cook for the party. I hope that you canmake it so as to transform them with your magical touch in the kitchen. Annabelle will be there as well to enjoy your soft chapatis. See you soon.

Yours Faithfully,
Dorothy Khaenzeli
